I'm an independent consultant with experience in projects using 8 and 32 bit microcontrollers, mobile application processors and embedded single board computers.

## Embedded Linux Experience:

* Successful board bring up of several fully custom boards mostly centered around Texas Instruments OMAP3 and OMAP4 processors.
* Low-level Android modifications with Ice Cream Sandwich (ICS) and Jelly Bean (JB)
* Extensive boot loader (u-boot and x-loader) customization and integration
* Extensive Linux kernel modifications to support custom boards and customer requirements
* Modifications range from customized boot configuration to full custom driver development
* Pro-actively implement forward looking solutions that track the direction of the open source upstream Linux kernel to enhance functionality as well as simplify kernel upgrade effort in the future
* On the fly competent hardware troubleshooting, diagnosis, and corrective action for early board spins
* Assist in hardware design by recommending enhancements drawing upon past experience and excellent understanding of boot loaders and low-level kernel hardware interfaces
* Development of a low-level user-space software interface to abstract away hardware details and enable re-use of higher level software on different hardware, projects, and products
* Experience assembling build environments constructed around Open Embedded and its derivatives (Angstrom, Arago) in an intelligent and user friendly manner
* Heavily leverage git source code management repositories to manage internal projects and stay synchronized with upstream repositories
* End of line factory deployment and testing applications

## Embedded Experience:

* Atmel AVR 8-bit microcontrollers and Cortex-M3 STM32 32-bit microcontrollers
* RF Wireless including Digi XBee, Digi 9XTend, 802.11 Wi-Fi
* Real-Time development using GCC C and associated tool chains
* Serial communications using UARTs, RS-232, RS-485, SPI, and CAN bus
* PCB design ranging from 2-4 layers
* I can do work ranging from proof of concept and prototyping to small production and beyond
* I have a special interest in motorsports applications

## Linux experience

* Daily use of Arch, Redhat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu and Gentoo Linux
* Linux Kernel driver and ACPI driver development
* Linux server administration (http, smtp, pop3, imap, dns, dhcp, rsync, ftp, ssh, nfs)
* General network administration
* Apache + countless modules such as (ie: mod_rewrite)
* PHP + MySQL (LAMP) webhosting platform
* NIS, Kerberos, OpenLDAP network information and directory services
* Samba file server
* Postfix mail server
* BIND DNS server
* IPTables Linux firewall
* VMWare, KVM-qemu, Virtual Box and LXC
* Source Code Management using Git and Subversion
* Linux Software RAID
* Device Mapper and Logical Volume Management
* Server specification and build
* I do projects on Time and Materials basis or in special cases Fixed Fee.  I require partial payment up front in good faith that the client is sincerely interested in the proposed project.
