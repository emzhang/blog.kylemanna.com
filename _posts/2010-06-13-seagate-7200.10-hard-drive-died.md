## How this Started

I run two **Seagate ST3250620AS** as my root file system with a Linux software RAID0 setup for my `/home` directory. These drives are from Seagate's 7200.10 series which were the first drives to switch to perpendicular recording some years ago.  This was a time when Seagate had a 5 year warranty for OEM drives and an immaculate reputation.

Starting on Friday, I heard my hard drive clicking.  Some quick investigation by looking at logs revealed that sdb was dying to some degree:

    Jun 11 14:21:41 core kernel: ata3.00: configured for UDMA/133
    Jun 11 14:21:41 core kernel: ata3: EH complete

I noticed the clicking when I took the side of my case off to look at something else, and figured maybe I bumped the cable.  I touched the cable and it seemed happy.  I wrote it off as a bad cable and replaced the cable later that day when I had a chance to power down the machine.  I noticed that one of the contacts was recessed a bit more then the others, so I swapped it and looked at the others.  Two others were bad, so I just threw them out and visually inspected the replacements.

Fast forward a few hours and it's acting up again.  This time I dig deeper with `smartctl` and run some tests, the first drive in the array passes without problems, but the other has some serious issues.  I downloaded Seagate's Seatools CD and booted off of that since my attempts at running the S.M.A.R.T. long test from Linux failed.  Running it from the CD found 2 bad sectors (on top of 7 that were already remapped) and give me the option to repair them, and so far so good.  See my `smartctl` data below.  Also note this drive is almost 4 years old but reports a lifetime of only 4718... I think that's an oops on Seagate's part as this drive has been on 24/7 since then.
