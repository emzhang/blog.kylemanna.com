**tl;dr [I'm Too Lazy to Read, give me the one liner](#im-too-lazy-to-read)** at the end.

## Gogo Inflight Internet Show Me How You Work

On a recent flight I decided to learn a bit how Gogo Inflight Internet WiFi does access control.  By connecting to the access point you're directed to a captive portal requesting payment and it seems unable to access the Internet otherwise.  A quick port scan of my remote server show that all ports except `80/tcp` and `3128/tcp` appear blocked.

During my layover, I forwarded port `3128/tcp` to `22/tcp` on my server to see if I could connect to OpenSSH.  Surprisingly it worked, and this little hole enabled me to remotely access the server and continue exploration.

The next was to fire up a [kylemanna/openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) server to proxy my data on port `3128/tcp`.  That worked as well.  However, everyone knows that [TCP in TCP tunnels are bad](http://sites.inka.de/bigred/devel/tcp-tcp.html), and by observing ping times on my flight blow up after a single lost packet, it behaves as poorly as expected.  No fun, no good, but surely a start.


## Check If the Firewall Relays UDP Traffic

A better performing solution uses TCP in UDP tunneling as tunnels are supposed to work.  To do that I fired up the same [kylemanna/openvpn](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn) image on my server with a slightly different configuration.  Boom!  Everything worked on my laptop and my cell phone through the OpenVPN tunnel.  The Internet at your fingertips through an apparent firewall hole.

But how would others do this?  Read on my friend.


## How to Setup OpenVPN on Port 3128/UDP

Before you get on a flight, setup a remote server like a [$5/mo Digital Ocean droplet](http://do.co/2fDHYVv) (Use my [promo code](http://do.co/2fDHYVv) to get a $10 credit!) in a region where you'll be traveling for best performance (i.e. San Francisco vs New York City). 

### Step 1 – Start A Server With Docker

I recommend selecting the Docker One-Click App from [Digital Ocean](http://do.co/2fDHYVv).

### Step 2 – Setup the OpenVPN Server Using Docker

Change `SERVER_IP` variable to match your server's public IP address.

    OVPN_DATA="ovpn-data"
    SERVER_IP="127.0.0.1"
    docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://$SERVER_IP:3128
    docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_initpki
    docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn -d -p 1194:3128/udp --cap-add=NET_ADMIN kylemanna/openvpn

Note, using the IP address is important in the likely event that DNS is broken until you connect to the VPN.

At this point, you should have a server running in the cloud.

### Step 3 – Generate a Client Certificate

Change `CLIENT` variable if you want more then one client as clients aren't allowed simultaneous connections.

    CLIENT=client1
    docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa build-client-full $CLIENT nopass
    docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient $CLIENT | tee $CLIENT.ovpn

### Step 4 – Copy the Client Certificate

This is up to you. I'd recommend `scp` to copy the `.ovpn` file to your laptop.  You could also try to `cat $CLIENT.ovpn` and copy-paste the certificate, but don't screw it up.

### Step 5 – Setup OpenVPN on Your Client

This is up to you as well, but I'll give you a hint at what I've tried:

* Linux: Simple as `sudo openvpn --config $CLIENT.ovpn` after installing the `openvpn` package.
* macOS: [Tunnelblick Project](https://tunnelblick.net/) and import the `$CLIENT.ovpn` package.
* Windows: Try the [installer from the OpenVPN project](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html) which needs to run `openvpn` as administrator.  I don't use Windows enough to figure out how to make this less painful, but it definitely works.
* Android: Check out [OpenVPN Connect App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn) after copying it to your device using MTP file transfer.
* iOS: Check out [OpenVPN Connect App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/openvpn-connect/id590379981?mt=8).  I have not tested this, let me know if it works.

### Step 6 – Place an Inflight Phone Call

Well, maybe.  You could do a VOIP phone call or a video chat, but please don't.  Your neighbors will hate you, for good reason.  Surf the web and try to get to [inbox zero](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=inbox+zero).


## I'm Too Lazy to Read

Well, I have a treat for you. A magic script that you can run as root (trust me! ha) and it'll generate one certificate for you on your disposable [$0.007/hr Digital Ocean droplet](http://do.co/2fDHYVv) that you can destroy at the end of your flight.

Quick and easy via a little [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/3adcd465e709b8ff3300202f12fdfff1):

    curl -L https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kylemanna/3adcd465e709b8ff3300202f12fdfff1/raw/gogo-firewall-bypass.sh | sudo bash
