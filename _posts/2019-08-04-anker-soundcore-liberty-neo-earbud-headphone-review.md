## Search for Ultimate Single Earbud Headphone Set

Last October I bought the [Anker Soundcore Liberty Lite](https://amzn.to/31rTiHp) (replaced by [Liberty Neo](https://amzn.to/2yPFyKh)) Headphones to wear while biking to work and motorcycling.

The goal was to wear one earbud so I could listen to music or podcasts with Google Maps directions if the situation necessitated it.  The other ear would remain open and available to listen to all the excitement of the road.  These headphones work well in single earbud mode, but it seems that only the right earbud works in this configuration.

The headphone stay in my ear while running and don't interfere with my bicycle helmet.  I removed the ear restraint "secure fit EarWings" as the wings themselves fall off.

They are low-enough profile that they seamlessly fit under my [Shoei RF1200 Motorcycle Helmet](https://amzn.to/31fsV7e).  I could wear both, but to date I've only worn the right earbud.

They do sound better then I expected and they certainly beat the wind noise on the highway and the medium silicon earbud "EarTips" fit my ears perfectly nullifying the need for the defunct EarWings.  

The earbuds have one button on each ear.  The right earbud button does the following:

* Short press to play/pause
* Medium length press to skip forward a track
* Long press to power off
* Extremely long press to enter pairing mode

Left earbud button does pretty much the same, except it skips backward a track.

I almost never power them off as it's kind of clumsy compared to just returning them to the charging case which automatically powers them down and charges them.

Volume is controlled by the phone, in my case an [Google Pixel 3](https://amzn.to/2KjzYGB) works great.

The microphone seems to work quite well as well for phone conversations despite the expectation that it would be quite bad given the placement of the microphone is in my ear.  This was a pleasant surprise when I accidentally answered a call with the earbud headphones on.

Unfortunately, I lost them at the airport.


## Enter Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo

I was quite sad to discover they hadn't survived my trip and immediately looked to replace them.  Anker Soundcore replaced them with the [Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo](https://amzn.to/2yPFyKh) earbud headphones.  These are pretty much indistinguishable except for the charging case (Why is it glossy now?! It always looks smudged.) and the "secure fit EarWings" have little rubber blanks installed, which have also fallen off.

But, they work justs as well. Maybe even better, but not noticeably different to me.

## In a Nutshell

If you want to listen to music, podcasts, or directions with a single earbud that doesn't interfere with a bicycle or motorcycle helmet buy the [Anker Soundcore Liberty Neo](https://amzn.to/2yPFyKh) headphones.
